To compile, use "make". 
To run the piecewise linear manipulation, type "./pr03 linear Mellieha_ZH-CN10970369201_1920x1080.ppm" (this is the picture included in the folder)
To run the cubic curve  manipulation, type "./pr03 cubic Mellieha_ZH-CN10970369201_1920x1080.ppm" (this is the picture included in the folder)
To change, type "./pr03 control.ppm Mellieha_ZH-CN10970369201_1920x1080.ppm" (The first picture is control picture, the second one is the actual output picture)

The parameters of linear and cubic curve are set up in pr03.cpp file.
