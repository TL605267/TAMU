To compile, use "make". 
To run the convolution, type "./pr04 convolution Mellieha_ZH-CN10970369201_1920x1080.ppm" (this is the picture included in the folder)
To run the emboss blur, type "./pr04 emboss Mellieha_ZH-CN10970369201_1920x1080.ppm" (this is the picture included in the folder)
To run the erosion blur, type "./pr04 erosion Mellieha_ZH-CN10970369201_1920x1080.ppm" (this is the picture included in the folder)
To run the motion blur (for extra credit), type "./pr04 motion Mellieha_ZH-CN10970369201_1920x1080.ppm" (this is the picture included in the folder)
The kernal and other parameters of convolution, emboss, and motion blur are set up in pr04.cpp file.
